/* Stick table header to sticky navbar */
/* .container {
  border: 1px solid black;
} */

/* On mobile, 100vh is not constant.
Browsers calculate vh based on the visible viewport height, which shrinks/expands as the address bar and navigation UI hide or reappear while scrolling.
So if you scroll quickly and the browser UI hides, 100vh suddenly becomes bigger, and if the UI reappears, 100vh shrinks.
That’s why your element sized in vh seems to jump or resize depending on scroll speed.
🔧 Fixes / Workarounds
Use dynamic viewport units (new CSS spec)
Modern browsers support:
dvh → dynamic viewport height (same as vh, but updates instantly).
lvh → large viewport height (when browser UI is hidden).
svh → small viewport height (when browser UI is visible). */
.table-wrapper {
  /* dynamic viewport height (same as vh, but updates instantly). */
  max-height: 80vh;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

thead {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}

thead th {
  cursor: pointer;
}
